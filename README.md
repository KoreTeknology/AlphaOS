### The aim of this project is to explore UI design and users interactions.
AlphaOS (from the CanvasLayer point of view) is a very simple operating system, demonstrating the interface blocs and mouse/keys actions. My goals here is to learn about alignments, bloc position, windows sizes and panels/dialogs.
